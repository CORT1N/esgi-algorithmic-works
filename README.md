# This repository was created to demonstrate the running times of different sorting and searching algorithms in Python for arrays of different sizes: 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 elements.

### Sorting algorithms used:
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Quicksort
- "Tri hollandais" from my french teacher or "Dutch National Flag Problem" sorting algorithm in english
- Merge sort

### Searching algorithms used:

- Linear search
